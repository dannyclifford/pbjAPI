There is a motion class that describes the actions necessary to create a pb&j sandwich

Index or main is the file that inherits from motion and defines the step by step process for making the sandwich itself in a much more human readable way. 

Updates on the motion class to come:
  fix twist/ untwist direction issue, create 2 constant variables for counterclockwise and clockwise
  define scoop
  define grab for knife
  define putting the two pieces of bread together
